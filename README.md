# Timeseries
Time series model for Microalgae prediction

**Time Series Analysis**
This repository contains Jupyter Notebook(s) for time series analysis, covering various techniques and tools to preprocess, analyze, and visualize time series data.

**project summary**
The main goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive resource for time series analysis, showcasing different methods for handling time series data, exploring patterns, and making forecasts. This can be useful for data scientists, researchers, and anyone interested in time series data analysis.

**Contents**
Time series Codes.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook with code examples and explanations for:
  Data loading and preprocessing
  Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for time series
  Various time series models and forecasting methods
  Visualizations of time series data

**Prerequisites**  
To run this project, you will need the following Python packages:  
- ```numpy ``` 
- ```pandas  ```
- ```matplotlib  ```
- ```seaborn  ```
- ```statsmodels```

To install the ```NumPy``` library, use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn statsmodels
```
To ensure your environment is equipped with all the necessary libraries, you can use the following installation code. This code installs each of the listed packages, including ```Prophet```, ```StatsModels```, ```scikit-learn```, ```Keras```, ```XGBoost```, and other commonly used libraries for time series analysis and machine learning.

```bash
# Install the necessary packages for time series analysis and machine learning
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn statsmodels scikit-learn keras xgboost

# Install Facebook Prophet (now called Prophet)
pip install prophet

```

```plaintext
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
statsmodels
scikit-learn
keras
xgboost
prophet
```
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Using these code blocks is an effective way to organize code, configuration files, and terminal commands
