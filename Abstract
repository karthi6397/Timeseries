The use of micro-algae for wastewater treatment is a promising technique that contributes CO2 capture and nutrient
recovery. However, the absence of a forecasting model hinders the application of microalgae on a larger scale. In this
study, a time-series-based forecasting model was designed to forecast the growth curve of microalgal biomass with
resembling environmental sample conditions. The collected data was trained with four machine-learning models:
LSTM, XGBoost, ARIMA, and Prophet. The model performance metrics were compared, and the best model was
identified. The results demonstrated that the LSTM method outperforms all other machine learning models, exhibiting
higher R2
values (0.75) and minimal errors. Residual analysis indicates a consistent spread across the range of
predicted values, indicating a normal distribution and the absence of outliers. The proposed model has the potential to
estimate microalgal growth trends, potentially mitigating the necessity for labor-intensive, costly, and time-consuming
laboratory trials
